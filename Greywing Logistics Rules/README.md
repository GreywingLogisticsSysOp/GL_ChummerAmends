# Code Conventions

* Blank line between each top level entry in a file for readability (i.e. every quality tag in quality_amends.xml)

* Group similar changes under one specific comment header, i.e. "6th Edition Cyberweapons"

* Use "6th Edition" rather than "6e", and similarly for 4e. "6e" will appear frequently in GUIDs, and is also the book tag used, which makes it harder to find relevant headers.
